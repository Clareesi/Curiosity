# Curiosity
At another CodeDay, my friends and I created a plot-based game with C# and Unity (our source code) in which a lonely robot named Curio wakes up on a post-apocalyptic Earth and collects his memories only to find that he was the source of Earthâ€™s destruction. The player controlled Curio by manipulating the gravity using arrow keys, and Curio had to dodge and hide from bullets being shot by enemies. The game was not finished during the CodeDay session, and many levels still need to be added in order to complete the plot.
